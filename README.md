# beat-recommender

This repo is a React application that uses Spotify API to recommend a beat. 

## User Flow
First, upon launch, the app will prompt the user to authorize connecting 
to their Spotify account. 
Second, after the user has authorized the use of an account,
they can search songs and add them to a list.
Thirdly, after they have added them to the list, they can push the send button
to ask for recommendation. The system will show a recommendation of a beat 
based on the key and tempo of the songs that are submitted.
